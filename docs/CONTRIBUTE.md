# How to Setup

Its a simple python application (unless we have web ui later)
```
python -m venv env
#(activate env through source. This step is specific for bash, zsh, fish, etc)
pip install -r requirements
	```

# Ways to contribute

## New module addition
1. Add utils under core/
2. Add frontend on modules/

## Web UI addition
How about a frontend/ and we store there?

## Improve Automation
1. See if you can master automation using the config.json inside core/ ?
2. Need a changelog.md auto create automation (with author and contributor name)

## Code optimisation and bugs
We all need smaller and smaller time and space for our programs :)

## Improve Docs
Gosh you can see I am terrible at it :( Please Help.
